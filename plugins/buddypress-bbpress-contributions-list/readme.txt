Display your BuddyPress and bbPress contributions

== Description ==

Have you ever contributed to BuddyPress or bbPress core development? Do you want to share those contributions on your website? Well now you can. This plugin comes with three convenient ways to display your contributions. You can show them via a WordPress template tag, a shortcode, or a dynamic widget. Contributions will automatically be linked to the Trac changeset so users can see all the details of what you gave back.

Trac data scraping code borrowed and modified from https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-contributions-widget/

Follow along with development on [GitHub](https://github.com/tw2113/buddypress-bbpress-contributions-list)
